;; Soju (and compatible) bouncer support via the IRCv3
;; `soju.im/bouncer-networks' extension.
;;
;; A "control" network entry configured with `:bouncer t' and the bare
;; bouncer `:username' (no \"/network\") connects to the bouncer, negotiates
;; the cap, and runs `BOUNCER LISTNETWORKS'.  The bouncer replies with a
;; `soju.im/bouncer-networks' batch of `BOUNCER NETWORK <netid> <attributes>'
;; entries.  This module then spawns a child connection per upstream network
;; -- each a normal clatter network with its own channels and chathistory --
;; by calling `clatter-connect' with the \"/network\" username form
;; (\"<bouncer-user>/<network-name>\"), which Soju routes to the chosen
;; upstream without any `BOUNCER BIND'.  Children carry a \"/network\"
;; username, so they are not control connections and never re-list (no
;; loops).
;;
;; Loading this file has no side effects; hooks are installed only when
;; `clatter-soju-enable' runs (wired into `clatter-setup' behind
;; `clatter-soju-enabled').  The hooks are no-ops on connections that do not
;; negotiate bouncer-networks.
